# Quantitative Text Analytics

*Text analytics* refers to applying statistical and machine learning techniques to extract useful insights from text 


Basics:

*Corpus*: body of text

*Token*: smallest unit of the text, e.g. words within a sentence, sentence within a text.

*Lexicon*: collection of words and their meanings. 

BoW
 dimensions are words, values are their frequences

Corpus: a data set = collection of documents
Lexicon:complete and distinct set of words used to define the corpus

High-dimensional, sparse, and non-negative representation
Dimensions: binary representation: 1 = the presence of a term in a document, 0, otherwise. 
most values of the dimensions are 0s, and only a few dimensions take on positive values

*Which token?*
a sentence, word, n-gram, morpheme, letter

Multidimensionality and sparseness of the data:
- Number of words -> dimensions of data
- Most word frequences are zero

Depends on 
- tasks
- their specification
- heuristics
- preconditions

## Bag-of-words (BoW) vs sequential representation (SR) of text 
Data-centric aspects: 
- length of the text: small for SR, longer for BoW

Application-centric aspects:
- method requires to treat sentences as sentences -> SR
e.g. text summarization, information extraction, opinion mining, and question answering

*BoW* 
- most commonly used representation for text mining
- the ordering of words is lost
- text is converted to a sparse multidimensional representation: the universe of words (or terms) are dimensions (or features) 
- **Application**: classification, topic-modeling, and recommender systems

*SR*
- the ordering is preserved: localized within sentence or paragraph boundaries
- text is a collection of smaller units, e.g. sentences, paragraphs 
- individual sentences are extracted as strings or sequences. 
- **Application**: language modeling, natural language processing

*Language Modeling*:probabilistic models that are able to predict the next word in the sequence given the words that precede it.

Uses: Machine Translation, spell Correction, speech Recognition, summarization, question answering, sentiment analysis etc.

## Text Preprocessing 
1. Text extraction


Data mining preceeds text analytics and refers to cleaning and data preparation: transformation of the unstructured text into a structured data


***
### Dealing with unstructured data 

* Information Retrieval
* Data preparation and cleaning
* Segmentation
* Tokenization
* Stop-word numbers and punctuation removal
* Convert to lowercase

* Converting to a "structured" form

    + Option 1 - tf df matrix:
    + Option 2 - tibble


tf df matrix approach:

* Stemming / 
* POS tagging
* Create text corpus
* Term-Document matrix

***
### Effective workflow for text analytics

Types of input:

Once the structured format is achieved, the data can go through 

* Modeling: inferential models, predictive models or prescriptive models
* Training and evaluation of models
* Application of these Models
* Visualizing the Models
* Google Cloud - Natural language API

Text summarization: customer complaints, customer feedback, monitoring compliance based call, chat monitoring.

Examples of text analytics: association analysis:

* visualization
* predictive analytics
* information retrieval
* lexical analysis
* pattern recognition
* tagging/annotation

Sentiment analysis
td-idf
network analysis of words
supervised text models
unsupervised text models


##td-idf
*term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency*

* statistical measure 

* shows importance of a word is in  a document in a collection of documents (corpus)

* the more times a word is used in a document, the higher the importance, but also how often a word appears in the corpus.

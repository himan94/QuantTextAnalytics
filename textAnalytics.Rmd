## Quantitative Text Analytics

Text analytics refers to applying statistical and machine learning techniques to describe or/and predict (infer?) any information from the data

Data mining preceeds text analytics and refers to cleaning and data preparation. It is roughly ETL (Extract Transfer Load) which is transform the unstructured text into a structured data
***
### Dealing with unstructured data 

Some common steps in dealing with unstructured data are:

text mining are as below

* Information Retrieval
* Data preparation and cleaning
* Segmentation
* Tokenization
* Stop-word numbers and punctuation removal
* Convert to lowercase

* Converting to a "structured" form

    + Option 1 - tf df matrix:
    + Option 2 - tibble


tf df matrix approach:

* Stemming / 
* POS tagging
* Create text corpus
* Term-Document matrix

***
### Effective workflow for text analytics
Once the structured format is achieved, the data can go through 

* Modeling: inferential models, predictive models or prescriptive models
* Training and evaluation of models
* Application of these Models
* Visualizing the Models
* Google Cloud - Natural language API




Examples of text analytics: association analysis:

* visualization
* predictive analytics
* information retrieval
* lexical analysis
* pattern recognition
* tagging/annotation

Sentiment analysis
td-idf
network analysis of words
supervised text models
unsupervised text models


##td-idf
*term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency*

* statistical measure 

* shows importance of a word is in  a document in a collection of documents (corpus)

* the more times a word is used in a document, the higher the importance, but also how often a word appears in the corpus.
